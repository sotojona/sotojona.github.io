# ¡¡Hello, I'm Jonathan 🎸!!
Welcome to my Gtihub profile ! 🙋‍♂️

I am a young, passionate, and focused Data Analyst aspiring to become a Data Scientist and AI Developer 🧠. With a solid background in Statistics 📊 and strong critical thinking 🧩 skills, I believe I can leverage data to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions.

Currently, I work as a Consultant at Masorange 💼, where I help clients optimize business processes, analyze large datasets, and deliver actionable insights 📈. Although my role focuses more on data-driven decision-making and business intelligence, I regularly apply my knowledge of statistical analysis, data management, and data visualization to provide valuable recommendations.

In addition to BigQuery for large-scale data analysis 🔍 and SAS for statistical modeling and reporting 📑, I’m continuously expanding my expertise in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 🤖, aiming to transition into those fields and develop cutting-edge solutions.
