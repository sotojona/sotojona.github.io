# ¡¡Hello, I'm Jonathan 🎸!!
Welcome to my Gtihub profile ! 🙋‍♂️

I am a young, passionate, and focused Data Analyst aspiring to become a Data Scientist and AI Developer 🧠. With a solid background in Statistics 📊 and strong critical thinking 🧩 skills, I believe I can leverage data to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions.

Currently, I work as a Consultant at Masorange 💼, where I help clients optimize business processes, analyze large datasets, and deliver actionable insights 📈. Although my role focuses more on data-driven decision-making and business intelligence, I regularly apply my knowledge of statistical analysis, data management, and data visualization to provide valuable recommendations.

In addition to BigQuery for large-scale data analysis 🔍 and SAS for statistical modeling and reporting 📑, I’m continuously expanding my expertise in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 🤖, aiming to transition into those fields and develop cutting-edge solutions.


## Skills 🛠
Programming & Tools: Python, SQL, R, SAS, BigQuery, Git, Excel

Data Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing, Regression, Time Series Analysis

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost (learning), Natural Language Processing (in progress)

Soft Skills: Communication, Problem-Solving, Adaptability, Critical Thinking


## Notable Projects 🌟
Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:

🧬 **Multinomial Logistic Regression for Predicting Erythematosquamous Diseases** – Developed a predictive model using multinomial logistic regression to classify the likelihood of patients developing various types of erythematosquamous diseases based on clinical and histopathological features. The project focused on medical data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to support early diagnosis and treatment planning. 


🛰 **Geospatial Analysis** – Analyzed spatial data to optimize location-based services for a logistics company.
🧠 NLP Sentiment Analyzer (Work in Progress) – Developing a sentiment analysis tool using Python and NLP libraries to classify customer feedback.
